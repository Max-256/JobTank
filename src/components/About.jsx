      <h3>Hi, welcome to the JobTank and here's our story...</h3>
      <p>
        We are a home to both recruiters and job seekers by providing a bridge
        in-between.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the JobTank, recruiters post open jobs. These are then accessed by a 
        wide number of prospective applicants which increases the chances of 
        getting really talented candidates. <br/>
        Applications then come in from a pool of candidates following the means
        of application as specified by the recruiter.
      </p>
      <p>We narrow the information gap between recruiters and applicants</p>
